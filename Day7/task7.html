        <p style="font-size: medium;">This RDF snippet defines relationships within an address book using SPARQL, RDF Schema, and OWL. It describes individuals (Richard Mutt, Craig Ellis, Cindy Marshall) and their relationships: Richard is married to Cindy (via the symmetric ab:spouse property), and Craig is a patient of Cindy (with the inverse properties ab:patient and ab:doctor). The ab:spouse property is symmetric, meaning if Richard is Cindy's spouse, then Cindy is also Richard's. The RDF schema and OWL constructs further clarify these relationships, establishing Cindy as both a spouse and a doctor to different individuals.</p>
