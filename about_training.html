            <h1>About the Training</h1>
            <p>The "Mastering the Semantic Web" training was conducted at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College from June 11 to July 10, 2024. Organized by the Testing and Consultancy Cell in collaboration with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, the training was led by Assistant Professor Er. Jaswant Singh. This program aimed to explore the Semantic Web, an advanced extension of the World Wide Web where information is assigned meaning, enabling computers and people to work together more efficiently. By structuring data on the web to be easily understandable by machines, the Semantic Web facilitates automated data integration, knowledge discovery, and more efficient information retrieval. The training covered key technologies including RDF (Resource Description Framework) for data representation, OWL (Web Ontology Language) for defining ontologies, and SPARQL for querying and manipulating data. The objective was to create a web of interconnected data that can be interpreted and utilized by intelligent systems, providing participants with deep insights and equipping them with the skills to leverage these technologies for innovative solutions in data management and knowledge discovery.</p>
